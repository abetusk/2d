Process
---

* Create at least four layers
  - original (untouched)
  - background (black)
  - frame (white outline)
  - main piece
* From the main piece, rework art to taste
* Threshold to taste
* Cleanup
* Add jittered pencil (size 3, jitter 8) to try and connect negative islands
* Create new image that has 20 extra pixels on each side
* Copy the main piece to new work and place it in the center
* Select the main work piece, copy it to new layer and invert. Make sure there is a solid outline of white.
* Convolve the white outline layer (convolution matrix of all 1s except for 0s on 4 corner cells) until the
  border is thick enough (twice did it for me)
* Make a base background layer that's black
* Createa group and put everything under the group in order
* Export the high level group as a PNG

Exporting
---

### LaserWeb

* Import image (`Add Document`)
* Deselect `Burn White`
* Select `Invert Color`
* Use `Cut Rate` of 4999
* Leave other parameters unchanged (`Laser Power Range = 0 Min, 0 Max`, `Laser Diameter = 0.2 (mm)`, `Passes = 1`)
* Under the `GCODE` section, hit `Generate` and make sure the preview matches the expectation of what should be burned
* Under the `GCODE` section, hit the save icon and save the exported GCode
* I like to clean up the file by removing comments and converting to *nix format
