* Convert the text to path
* Outset twice
* Do a path union
* Duplicate 3x (two more times) and position them
* Union on the resulting outer edge
* Clean up middle (delete small islands)
* Position original text converting each character to path
* Do a pairwise difference from the background offset to the individual character
* Create a circle, convert path and do a union
* Create a smaller circle inside and do a path difference
* Import from laserweb (it says it has minor issues but it doesn't seem to make a difference?)
* Export to GCode

so about 70mm side (for murder)?

* 70mm x size for `murder2.svg` and `murder2-outline.svg`
* 60mm y size for `kill2.svg` and `kill2-outline.svg`

a bit too small, now doing 80mm wide for murder and 70mm for kill?

`laserweb` is having problems ordering the cut.
To get around it, I've used a chain of programs packaged in
`prep-mk.sh` to create a file with `-x.ngc` extension with
the proper ordering.
This makes some assumptions (decimal units, how the laser power is
specified, etc.) so it's only good for this purpose.
